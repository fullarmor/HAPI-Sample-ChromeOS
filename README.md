The Chrome OS App provides a sample Chrome OS File System Provider API App using HAPI. The app allows Active Directory (AD) authentication and access to both on-premise AD and HAPI agent files and folders as a virtual file system in Chrome OSâ€™ file manager. The entire Chrome File System Provider API has been implemented to include mount, un-mount, download, upload, edit, create, rename, cut, copy and paste for files and folders.
